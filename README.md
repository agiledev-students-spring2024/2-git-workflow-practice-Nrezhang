[10 unconventional lessons from 10 years working as a software engineer](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/10-unconventional-lessons-from-10-years-working-as-a-software-engineer-873d5d4ae4a2)

## My Takewaways

This article is written by someone who has walked the career path that I aspire to take in the future. The core ideas of the article are to prioritize learning and push yourself to do things out of your comfort zone, while still maintaining a balanced life. While this article is not the most technical piece of work with ideas/terminology to learn from, and I myself am not working in the industry yet, I still gained valuble insight into how I should aproach coding and life in general. This article gives me some comfort in the fact that working as a software engineer is a long term endeavor. Knowledge compounds over time, and is not overnight, so as long as I maintain a "strong learning mindset and being patient and disciplined."

## Navid's Comments

I agree with the statement that having an eagerness to learn more will help over time in a career such as being a software engineer. It is a field that is constantly changing and it is important to stay up to date with the newest trends. Additionally, it is always good to keep learning new things. This is how someone can come up with new ideas and innovations as well as bring new perspectives to teams and projects. In the article, he mentions that one should "master the 20% that will allow you to deliver 80% of the tasks" which I think is also a good way of prioritizing what to learn. This can help to understand a variety of different technologies any of which can later stem into a more in depth project.
